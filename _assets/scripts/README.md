title: Scripts Storage
description: Internal folder for downloadable scripts referenced in docs
---

Use this folder to store scripts that should be downloadable via raw GitHub links without showing up in the docs navigation. Keep other hidden assets in sibling subfolders under `_assets/`.

- Keep scripts in this folder (or subfolders) and link to the raw URL, e.g. `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/<repo>/main/_assets/scripts/setup.sh`.
- Name files descriptively and include brief inline comments for usage.
- If a script needs accompanying instructions, add them to the relevant doc page rather than here.
