title: Unlisted Assets
description: Container for docs assets that should not appear in navigation
---

Use this folder for any unlisted documentation assets (scripts, examples, downloads) that you want to link directly via raw GitHub URLs without exposing them in the docs sidebar.

- Add asset-type subfolders (e.g., `nvidia-spark-playbook/`, `samples/`, `configs/`) to keep files organized.
- Reference files using their raw URLs, for example: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/<repo>/main/_assets/nvidia-spark-playbook/bash/run.sh`.
- Keep usage instructions in the public docs pages; keep this area tidy and purpose-built for downloads.
