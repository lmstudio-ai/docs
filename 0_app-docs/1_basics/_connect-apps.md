### Selecting a Theme

You can choose a theme in the Settings tab.

Choosing the "Auto" option will automatically switch between Light and Dark themes based on your system settings.

You can jump to Settings from anywhere in the app by pressing `cmd` + `,` on macOS or `ctrl` + `,` on Windows/Linux.
