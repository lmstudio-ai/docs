You can use openly available Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama 3.1, Phi-3, and Gemma 2 locally in LM Studio, leveraging your computer's CPU and optionally the GPU.

Double check computer meets the minimum [system requirements](/docs/system-requirements).

```lms_info
You might sometimes see terms such as `open-source models` or `open-weights models`. Different models might be released under different licenses and varying degrees of 'openness'. In order to run a model locally, you need to be able to get access to its "weights", often distributed as one or more files that end with `.gguf`, `.safetensors` etc.

## Getting up and running

First, **install the latest version of LM Studio**. You can get it from [here](/download).

Once you're all set up, you need to **download your first LLM**.

### 1. Download an LLM to your computer

Head over to the Discover tab to download models. Pick one of the curated options or search for models by search query (e.g. `"Llama"`). See more in-depth information about downloading models [here](/docs/basics/download-models).

### 2. Load a model to memory

Head over to the **Chat** tab, and

1. Open the model loader
2. Select one of the models you downloaded (or [sideloaded](/docs/advanced/sideload)).
3. Optionally, choose load configuration parameters.

##### What does loading a model mean?

Loading a model typically means allocating memory to be able to accomodate the model's weights and other parameters in your computer's RAM.

### 3. Chat!

Once the model is loaded, you can start a back-and-forth conversation with the model in the Chat tab.
