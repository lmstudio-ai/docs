Intro about LM Studio SDKs in general and what capabilities are supported.

(should probably reference [Running LM Studio as a server](/docs/headless))

## How to get started

Language specific introductions are provided to help new users get started:

* [Getting started with the LM Studio Python SDK](/docs/sdk/python)
* [Getting started with the LM Studio Typescript SDK](/docs/sdk/typescript)

## Next steps

The remainder of this SDK documentation then covers specific operations in detail
for each language, with example code provided for:

* the Python convenience API (intended primarily for interactive use)
* the Python client instance API (which offers more explicit resource management)
* the Typescript SDK
