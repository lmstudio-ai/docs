## Requesting Access

<img src="/assets/docs/lmlink-sidebar.gif"/>

To get started, find the LM Link icon in the LM Studio app, just above the Settings gear icon. LM Link is a network between your devices, so log-in is required to associate devices to users in order to facilitate discovery.

A custom link is **automatically provisioned** for you the first time you access the feature. 

Once your first device has joined the link, [add another device](/docs/lmlink/basics/add-device) to experience the power of LM Link!
