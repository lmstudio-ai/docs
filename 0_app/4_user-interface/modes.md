### Which mode should I choose?

#### `User`

Show only the chat interface, and auto-configure everything. This is the best choice for beginners or anyone who's happy with the default settings.

#### `Power User`

Use LM Studio in this mode if you want access to configurable [load](/docs/configuration/load) and [inference](/docs/configuration/inference) parameters as well as advanced chat features such as [insert, edit, &amp; continue](/docs/advanced/context) (for either role, user or assistant).

#### `Developer`

Full access to all aspects in LM Studio. This includes keyboard shortcuts and development features. Check out the Developer section under Settings for more.
