### Run an LLM like `Llama`, `Phi`, or `DeepSeek R1` on your computer

To run an LLM on your computer you first need to download the model weights.

You can do this right within LM Studio! See [Download an LLM](app/basics/download-model) for guidance.

### Chat with documents entirely offline on your computer

You can attach documents to your chat messages and interact with them entirely offline, also known as "RAG".

LM Studio provides a REST API that you can use to interact with your local models from your own apps and scripts.
