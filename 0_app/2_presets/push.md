`Feature In Preview`

Starting LM Studio 0.3.15, you can publish your Presets to the LM Studio community. This allows you to share your Presets with others and import Presets from other users.

This feature is early and we would love to hear your feedback. Please report bugs and feedback to bugs@lmstudio.ai.

## Published Presets

Presets you share on the LM Studio Hub can be updated.

## Step 1: Make Changes and Commit

Make any changes to your Preset, both in parameters that are already included in the Preset, or by adding new parameters.

## Step 2: Click the Push Button
Once changes are committed, you will see a `Push` button. Click it to push your changes to the Hub. 

Pushing changes will result in a new revision of your Preset on the Hub.
