`Feature In Preview`

Starting LM Studio 0.3.15, you can publish your Presets to the LM Studio community. This allows you to share your Presets with others and import Presets from other users.

This feature is early and we would love to hear your feedback. Please report bugs and feedback to bugs@lmstudio.ai.
