### Which mode should I choose?

#### `User`
Show only the chat interface, no configuration parameters whatsoever. The best choice for beginners or anyone who's content with default settings.

#### `Power User`
Use LM Studio in this mode if you want access to configurable [load](/docs/configuration/load) and [inference](/docs/configuration/inference) parameters and advanced chat features such as [insert, edit, &amp; continue](/docs/advanced/context) messages (of either role, user or assistant).

#### `Developer`
Full access to every configurable parameter in LM Studio, including [keyboard shortcuts](/docs/keychords) and development
