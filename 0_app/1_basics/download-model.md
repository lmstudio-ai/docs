LM Studio comes with a built-in model downloader that let's you download any supported model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co).

### Searching for models

You can search for models by keyword (e.g. `llama`, `gemma`, `lmstudio`), or by providing a specific `user/model` string. You can even insert full Hugging Face URLs into the search bar!

###### Pro tip: you can jump to the Discover tab from anywhere by pressing `âŒ˜` + `2` on Mac, or `ctrl` + `2` on Windows / Linux.

### Which download option to choose?

You will often see several options for any given model named things like `Q3_K_S`, `Q_8` etc. These are all copies of the same model, provided in varying degrees of fidelity. The `Q` represents a technique called "Quantization", which roughly means compressing model files in size, while giving up some degree of quality.

Choose a 4-bit option or higher if your machine is capable enough for running it.
