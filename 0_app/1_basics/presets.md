Configuration Presets are new in LM Studio 0.3.3 ([Release Notes](/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.3))

#### The Use Case for Presets

- Save your system prompts, inference parameters as a named `Preset`.
- Easily switch between different use cases, such as reasoning, creative writing, multi-turn conversations, or brainstorming.

_For migration from LM Studio 0.2.\* Presets, see [below](#migration-from-lm-studio-0-2-presets)_.

**Please report bugs and feedback to bugs [at] lmstudio [dot] ai.**

### Build your own Prompt Library

You can create your own prompt library by using Presets.

In addition to system prompts, every parameter under the Advanced Configuration sidebar can be recorded in a named Preset.

For example, you might want to always use a certain Temperature, Top P, or Max Tokens for a particular use case. You can save these settings as a Preset (with or without a system prompt) and easily switch between them.

### Saving, resetting, and deselecting Presets

Below is the anatomy of the Preset manager:

### Migration from LM Studio 0.2.\* Presets

- Presets you've saved in LM Studio 0.2.\* are automatically readable in 0.3.3 with no migration step needed.
- If you save **new changes** in a **legacy preset**, it'll be **copied** to a new format upon save.
  - The old files are NOT deleted.
- Notable difference: Load parameters are not included in the new preset format.
  - Favor editing the model's default config in My Models. See [how to do it here](/docs/configuration/per-model).

### Where Presets are stored

Presets are stored in the following directory:

#### macOS or Linux

```xml
~/.lmstudio/config-presets
```

#### Windows

```xml
%USERPROFILE%\.lmstudio\config-presets
```
