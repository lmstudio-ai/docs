title: Get Model Info
description: Get information about the model
---

You can access general information and metadata about a model itself from a loaded
instance of that model.

In the below examples, the LLM reference can be replaced with an
embedding model reference without requiring any other changes.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        model = lms.llm()

        print(model.get_info())

    "Python (scoped resource API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        with lms.Client() as client:
            model = client.llm.model()

            print(model.get_info())
```

## Example output

```python
LlmInstanceInfo.from_dict({
  "architecture": "qwen2",
  "contextLength": 4096,
  "displayName": "Qwen2.5 7B Instruct 1M",
  "format": "gguf",
  "identifier": "qwen2.5-7b-instruct",
  "instanceReference": "lpFZPBQjhSZPrFevGyY6Leq8",
  "maxContextLength": 1010000,
  "modelKey": "qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m",
  "paramsString": "7B",
  "path": "lmstudio-community/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M-GGUF/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M-Q4_K_M.gguf",
  "sizeBytes": 4683073888,
  "trainedForToolUse": true,
  "type": "llm",
  "vision": false
})
```
