description: Generate text embeddings from input text
---

Generate embeddings for input text. Embeddings are vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning. Embeddings are a building block for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and other similarity-based tasks.

### Prerequisite: Get an Embedding Model

If you don't yet have an embedding model, you can download a model like `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5` using the following command:

```bash
lms get nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5
```

## Create Embeddings

To convert a string to a vector representation, pass it to the `embed` method on the corresponding embedding model handle.

      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        const client = new LMStudioClient();

        const model = await client.embedding.model("nomic-embed-text-v1.5");

        const { embedding } = await model.embed("Hello, world!");
```
