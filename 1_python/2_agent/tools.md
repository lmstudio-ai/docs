You can define tools as regular Python functions and pass them to the model in the `act()` call.
Alternatively, tools can be defined with `lmstudio.ToolFunctionDef` in order to control the
name and description passed to the language model.

## Anatomy of a Tool

Follow one of the following examples to define functions as tools (the first approach
is typically going to be the most convenient):

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python function":
      language: python
      code: |
        # Type hinted functions with clear names and docstrings
        # may be used directly as tool definitions
        def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
            """Given two numbers a and b, returns the sum of them."""
            # The SDK ensures arguments are coerced to their specified types
            return a + b

        # Pass `add` directly to `act()` as a tool definition

    "ToolFunctionDef.from_callable":
      language: python
      code: |
        from lmstudio import ToolFunctionDef

        def cryptic_name(a: int, b: int) -> int:
            return a + b

        # Type hinted functions with cryptic names and missing or poor docstrings
        # can be turned into clear tool definitions with `from_callable`
        tool_def = ToolFunctionDef.from_callable(
          cryptic_name,
          name="add",
          description="Given two numbers a and b, returns the sum of them."
        )
        # Pass `tool_def` to `act()` as a tool definition

    "ToolFunctionDef":
      language: python
      code: |
        from lmstudio import ToolFunctionDef

        def cryptic_name(a, b):
            return a + b

        # Functions without type hints can be used without wrapping them
        # at runtime by defining a tool function directly.
        tool_def = ToolFunctionDef(
          name="add",
          description="Given two numbers a and b, returns the sum of them.",
          parameters={
            "a": int,
            "b": int,
          },
          implementation=cryptic_name,
        )
        # Pass `tool_def` to `act()` as a tool definition

```

**Important**: The tool name, description, and the parameter definitions are all passed to the model!

This means that your wording will affect the quality of the generation. Make sure to always provide a clear description of the tool so the model knows how to use it.

## Tools with External Effects (like Computer Use or API Calls)

Tools can also have external effects, such as creating files or calling programs and even APIs. By implementing tools with external effects, you
can essentially turn your LLMs into autonomous agents that can perform tasks on your local machine.

## Example: `create_file_tool`

### Tool Definition

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "create_file_tool.py"
  variants:
    Python:
      language: python
      code: |
        from pathlib import Path

        def create_file(name: str, content: str):
            """Create a file with the given name and content."""
            dest_path = Path(name)
            if dest_path.exists():
                return "Error: File already exists."
            try:
                dest_path.write_text(content, encoding="utf-8")
            except Exception as exc:
                return "Error: {exc!r}"
            return "File created."

```

### Example code using the `create_file` tool:

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "example.py"
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        from create_file_tool import create_file

        model = lms.llm("qwen2.5-7b-instruct")
        model.act(
          "Please create a file named output.txt with your understanding of the meaning of life.",
          [create_file],
        )
```

## Handling tool calling errors

By default, version 1.3.0 and later of the Python SDK will automatically convert exceptions raised by tool calls to text and report them back to the language model.
In many cases, when notified of an error in this way, a language model is able
to either adjust its request to avoid the failure, or else accept the failure as
a valid response to its request (consider a prompt like `Attempt to divide 1 by 0
using the provided tool. Explain the result.`, where the expected
response is an explanation of the `ZeroDivisionError` exception the Python
interpreter raises when instructed to divide by zero).

This error handling behaviour can be overridden using the `handle_invalid_tool_request`
callback. For example, the following code reverts the error handling back to raising
exceptions locally in the client:

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "example.py"
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        model = lms.llm("qwen2.5-7b-instruct")
        chat = Chat()
        chat.add_user_message(
            "Attempt to divide 1 by 0 using the tool. Explain the result."
        )

        def _raise_exc_in_client(
            exc: LMStudioPredictionError, request: ToolCallRequest | None
        ) -> None:
            raise exc

        act_result = llm.act(
            chat,
            [divide],
            handle_invalid_tool_request=_raise_exc_in_client,
        )
```

When a tool request is passed in, the callback results are processed as follows:

* `None`: the original exception text is passed to the LLM unmodified
* a string: the returned string is passed to the LLM instead of the original
  exception text
* raising an exception (whether the passed in exception or a new exception):
  the raised exception is propagated locally in the client, terminating the
  prediction process

If no tool request is passed in, the callback invocation is a notification only,
and the exception cannot be converted to text for passing pack to the LLM
(although it can still be replaced with a different exception). These cases
indicate failures in the expected communication with the server API that mean
the prediction process cannot reasonably continue.
