description: APIs for representing a chat conversation with an LLM
---

SDK methods such as `llm.respond()`, `llm.applyPromptTemplate()`, or `llm.act()`
take in a chat parameter as an input.
There are a few ways to represent a chat when using the SDK.

## Option 1: Input a Single String

If your chat only has one single user message, you can use a single string to represent the chat.
Here is an example with the `.respond` method.

```lms_code_snippet
variants:
  "Single string":
    language: python
    code: |
      prediction = llm.respond("What is the meaning of life?")
```

## Option 2: Using the `Chat` Helper Class

For more complex tasks, it is recommended to use the `Chat` helper class.
It provides various commonly used methods to manage the chat.
Here is an example with the `Chat` class.

```lms_code_snippet
variants:
  "Simple chat":
    language: python
    code: |
      chat = Chat("You are a resident AI philosopher.")
      chat.add_user_message("What is the meaning of life?")

      prediction = llm.respond(chat)
```

You can also quickly construct a `Chat` object using the `Chat.from_history` method.

```lms_code_snippet
variants:
  "Chat history data":
    language: python
    code: |
      chat = Chat.from_history({"messages": [
        { "role": "system", "content": "You are a resident AI philosopher." },
        { "role": "user", "content": "What is the meaning of life?" },
      ]})

  "Single string":
    language: python
    code: |
      # This constructs a chat with a single user message
      chat = Chat.from_history("What is the meaning of life?")

```

## Option 3: Providing Chat History Data Directly

As the APIs that accept chat histories use `Chat.from_history` internally,
they also accept the chat history data format as a regular dictionary:

```lms_code_snippet
variants:
  "Chat history data":
    language: python
    code: |
      prediction = llm.respond({"messages": [
        { "role": "system", "content": "You are a resident AI philosopher." },
        { "role": "user", "content": "What is the meaning of life?" },
      ]})
```
