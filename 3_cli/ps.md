## Operate on a remote LM Studio instance

`lms ps` supports the `--host` flag to connect to a remote LM Studio instance:

```shell
lms ps --host <host>
```

For this to work, the remote LM Studio instance must be running and accessible from your local machine, e.g. be accessible on the same subnet.
